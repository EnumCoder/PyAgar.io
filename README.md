# Game Modes:

 * This gamemode will offer lots of commands and access to the games server from within the game, most of which will be commands or with limited gui features...

# Server Structure:
 * The gameserver will support multi-threading. It's too early in development to expect any really advanced structure at this time, however when the gameserver is stable, code improvement will take place.
