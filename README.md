# Dev mode:
This gamemode will offer lots of commands and access to the games server from within the game, most of which will be commands or with limited gui features...

# Server structure:
The gameserver will support multi-threading. It's too early in development to expect any really advanced structure at this time, however when the gameserver is stable, code improvement will take place.

# Commands:
None as of now...
